<h1>Power-Portals</h1>
<p>A Spigot plugin for Minecraft that adds interconnected portals. This plugin is still under development and should not be depended on for stable use on any    public server. This plugin is heavily inspired by the now abandoned <a href="https://github.com/WolfNetDevelopment/Wormhole-X-Treme">Wormhole-X-Treme</a> Bukkit plugin for Minecraft.</p>
