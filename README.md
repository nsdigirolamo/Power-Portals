<h1>Power-Portals</h1>
<p>A Spigot plugin for Minecraft that adds interconnected portals. This plugin is still under development and should not be depended on for stable use on a    public server. This plugin is heavily inspired by the now abandoned <a href="https://github.com/WolfNetDevelopment/Wormhole-X-Treme">Wormhole-X-Treme</a> Bukkit plugin for Minecraft.</p>
<h2>Short Term Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Add large portals</li>
  <li>Add a list command</li>
  <li>Add portal passwords as an option for players</li>
  <li>Add portal statistics so players can see the number of visitors to their portal</li>
</ul>
<h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow for custom portal designs</li>
  <li>Use a database for storing portals instead of a json file</li>
  <li>Maybe allow for entities to pass through portals?</li>
  <li>Actually get the plugin to a releasable state</li>
</ul>
