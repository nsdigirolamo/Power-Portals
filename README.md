# Power-Portals
<p>A Spigot plugin for Minecraft that adds interconnected portals. This plugin is still under development and should not be used on any public servers.</p>
<p>Heavily inspired by the now abandoned <a href="https://github.com/WolfNetDevelopment/Wormhole-X-Treme">Wormhole-X-Treme</a> Bukkit plugin for Minecraft.</p>
